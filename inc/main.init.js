All that said, love it or hate it, Overcome by Happiness has three undeniable qualities that I need as a listener of music: The songwriting is pretty good. The performances top-to-bottom are evocative. And the recording captured a vibe. Being able to say that makes me feel pretty good. I like to think Overcome by Happiness is an album some other Joe Pernice out there might enjoy hearing.As always, thanks for listening.JP, Toronto, 2022'","5":"b''","6":"b''","7":"b'STAYING ON TWO FEET THE PERNICE BROTHERS AND OVERCOME BY HAPPINESSStephen Deusnern 2007, an AOL Music publication countedDeath becomes the most unceremonious aspect ofthat realization only compounds the sadness of down the Most Exquisitely Sad Songs in thelife, ornamented only by the mundane contents ofChicken Wire.Whole World, and a leftfield choice topped the list.a suburban garage.

Chicken Wire and other songs on Overcome by Happiness may have diminishing returns for him, but for his fans they still sound as devastating in 2023 as they did the first time they heard them. I dont even think I was trying to reach people, he says now. I was more trying to get something out of myself, which is why I was stunned by the positive reaction to these songs. I wasnt writing them for other people. I was writing them for myself, and then you have people who come up to you and say that one of those songs changed their life. That blows my mind, because at the time I was just trying to sustain my own life. I was just trying to stay on two feet. The story of Overcome by Happiness is one of great risk and greater payoff. Its the story of a disgruntled country singer struggling to define himself against prevailing musical trends. Its the story of a songwriter just finding his voice, an artist so desperate to express himself that he scrapped one band to form another, jeopardizing his record contract and arguably his career to put what he heard in his head onto tape. Its the story of a musician embracing the sounds of his childhood: AM easy listening, sophisticated chamber pop, baroque lounge music, Bread, the Carpenters, Bacharach, Manilow. Its the story of a poet driving through Massachusetts in a rusted-out Bonneville with a wooden bumper. The Pernice Brothers was never a conceptual project, nor a reclamation mission, but rather a sincere exploration by a songwriter only a year or two removed from his MFA studies, who wrote literary songs without the baggage that adjective often implies, who discovered a particular and very personal style of songwriting that hes still refining today.You dont want your stuff to vanish, says Joe about the 25th anniver-sary reissue of Overcome by Happiness. Not that Im looking to get famous, but you need to connect with the world. Theres something that reaffirms your own life in that echo that comes back to youeven if its your own voice coming back.'","9":"b''","10":"b'Joe Pernice lyrics and session notebook'","11":"b\"Early '70s Gibson Blue Ridge used to write and record Overcome by Happinesshe story begins in an average kids bedroomHarvard, who owned and founded Fort ApacheMusic was merely a hobby for both of the Pernice somewhere outside Boston and somewhereStudios in Boston.

They released their debut, Pine Box, in January 1995 (featuring liner notes from Silver Jews David Berman). Their sophomore album, Dance the Night Away, arrived in February 1995. By the time they signed with Sub Pop Records just a few months later, theyd already written most of their third album, Massachusetts, which was recorded in October 1995 and released in April 1996.They ended up on the indie label due to the enthu-siasm of Joyce Linehan, who had managed the Providence, Rhode Island, band Six Finger Satellite and opened an East Coast office for Sub Pop. After discovering the Scud Mountain Boys via their split single with Steve Westfield & the Slow Band (whose side featured a guest appearance from Lou Barlow of Sebadoh and Dinosaur Jr.), I did a little sleuthing, which was a lot harder back then, she says. It turned out that Joe and I had a lot of things in common. Were both from the eastern part of Massachusetts, and I knew his cousin, Joe Harvard. It was a small indie-rock world, and a small Boston world, so it was surprising that we didnt know each other already.The Scud Mountain Boys compressed career coincided with the heyday of the alt-country movement, and their songs dripped with pedal steel and bristled with twangy guitar licks. Given the austerity of their sound and the unhurried clip of their tempos, however, they arguably had more in common with slowcore acts like Low and Codeine than they had with yallternative groups like Son Volt and the Jayhawks. More crucially, Joe never felt like a country artist; as a singer, he had no southern drawl, and as a songwriter, he didnt pretend he had any experience with honkytonks or rodeos. He had nothing against the genre itself, but there were other sounds rattling around in his head. In fact, many of the pop elements that defined the Pernice Brothers were already present on the Scud Mountain Boys first three albums: an emphasis on mood and melody, a careful deployment of words '","13":"b''","14":"b'and sentiments, song structures that rejected theMountain Boys did, but I was already branching outbest friends at the time.
